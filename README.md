## Problems that the application solves

In our country, mental illness is still considered a taboo. People do not talk about it. Most of them think it is not even normal.
Our application will help them to comminucate with people like them, making them realize they are not alone who are suffering from this.  
Team codegonewild is proposing an application called **'Quell'**, which will let users communicate to each other. They would be able to opt the illness that they are suffering from after registering themselves. We would be allotting groups comprising of 3 other users and one therapist.
We will be performing sentiment analysis on the recent messages of the group to make sure to take some steps if users of a particular group are feeling too sad and suicidal. In that case, the bot would send some happy messages to the users of the group in the same way a good friend would check up on us when we don't feel good. Meanwhile, letting the therapist know about the descending group score.
